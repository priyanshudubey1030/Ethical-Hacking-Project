Minor Project - 1
Project 1: Linux IAM & Hardening mini (Users, Groups, Permissions)Objective:
Design and implement a secure user/group and permission model on an Ubuntu server, find 3 misconfigurations in a deliberately vulnerable lab VM, fix them, and produce a remediation report.Tools / Environment:
Ubuntu VM (lab), Kali or attacker VM for safe testing, sudo access to lab VM.Tasks:
Task 1: Policy + create users/groups + set permissions, enable auditing.
Task 2: Vulnerable snapshot analysis, fix issues, produce report + checklist.Task 1: Policy + create users/groups + set permissions, enable auditing:
Create a baseline policy document: who needs sudo, group roles, and file access requirements for a small team (e.g., admin, dev, auditor).
On an Ubuntu VM, create users and groups according to the policy (use useradd, groupadd).Assign minimal privileges: configure sudoers using any text editor with least-privilege rules, set sudo rules for specific commands only.Use POSIX permissions + ACLs for a shared project folder so that only the intended group has write access; others have read-only.Enable simple auditing (auditd) to log changes to /etc/sudoers and /etc/passwd.In a separate vulnerable snapshot (instructor provides or students intentionally misconfigure), identify three misconfigurations (e.g., world-writable /etc/cron.d, unrestricted sudo NOPASSWD, weak file permissions on sensitive files).Task 2: Vulnerable snapshot analysis, fix issues, produce report + checklist:
Fix those misconfigurations, document steps, and show before/after evidence (ls -l, getfacl, audit logs).Produce a remediation checklist and a short policy document for ongoing user management.Evidence (screenshots or text) showing misconfiguration discovery & fixes.Audit logs snippet showing tracked changes.Remediation checklistSUMMARY
